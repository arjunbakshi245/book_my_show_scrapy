1. Modules and Libraries put to use:-
	a) Scrapy(pip install scrapy)
	b) Tkinter[GUI]
	c) Pandas(pip install pandas)[for traversal and conversion of csv, text and html files]

Note: The scrapy module for the project was installed within a virtual environment to prohibit its relation with the PC
      by cmd (virtualenv .) .

2. pywin32 is also required to installed within the virtualenv or even outside.(pip install pywin)

3. After completing the prereqisites and activating the virtual env type (scrapy startproject "Name")
	"Name" in our project was stored as bookmyshow
	This command through scrapy automatically creates the required docs and sets up a project.

4. Once the code is complete , activate the virtual env by .\Scripts\activate after directing to the project folder , to run
   the spider the command "scrapy crawl Namespider". In our project-- (scrapy crawl bookmyshowspider)

5. SublimeText3 and Visual Studio Code were also used as the edidtors , as for compiling , we used the PC command line itself.
